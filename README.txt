This project idea was essentially taken from a game that is called "Aim Hero" on Steam. Me and my friend, for we didn't
want to spend money on the real "Aim Hero", has decided to make our own version of it. This is made using Processing, 
through this project, we learned 3D graphics and additionally, we discovered the secrets of camera movement in a 3D space.
